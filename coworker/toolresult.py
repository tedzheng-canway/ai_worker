"""Bound every tool result before it enters the conversation (OPE-186, change 1).

A tool result is re-sent to the model on every later turn, so one oversized result taxes
the whole rest of the session. The shell tool used to keep the LAST 20,000 characters of
its output and drop the beginning; every other tool was unbounded (a `read_file` of a
486,000-character file was seen in one long session).

Rule, applied in one place for all tools (`TurnEngine._record_result`): if the result, as
it would be serialised into the tool message, exceeds `max_bytes`, the full text is written
to a spill file and the oversized field is replaced by its head, a marker naming the file
and the omitted byte count, and its tail. Head-plus-tail at 10,000 bytes is a common shape;
another is to keep the full output on disk and hand the model only the path.
Head AND tail because a build log needs both its first error and its final verdict.

The marker carries no timestamp, so a bounded result is byte-identical on every later
request and never disturbs the provider's prompt cache. Structured results stay valid
JSON: only the largest string field(s) are bounded, everything else is untouched.
