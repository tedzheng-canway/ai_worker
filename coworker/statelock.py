"""One engine per state directory.

Two engines writing one state dir corrupt each other quietly: SQLite rows
vanish behind a cached handle, boards get two writers, sessions double-wake.
The failure we actually shipped was two systemd user units on one VM, both
running `openworker up` (a stale `openworker.service` from the first machine
test beside the hand-written unit) — every "kill the stray" was undone by
`Restart=always` five seconds later. This lock makes the second engine say so
and stop, instead of running.

`acquire()` holds an advisory lock on `<state>/engine.lock` for the life of
the returned handle (the process, in practice) and records the holder's pid
in the file for the refusal message. POSIX uses flock; Windows uses
msvcrt.locking on a reserved byte beyond the PID, so Windows readers can
still read the holder's identity while the lock is held.
