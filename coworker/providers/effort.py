"""Reasoning-effort levels and their per-provider translation (OPE-176).

One setting, `reasoning_effort`, five levels mirroring Anthropic's: low, medium, high,
xhigh, max. Unset means "send nothing" — every provider's request stays byte-identical to
before the setting existed (Anthropic's API default is `high`; Together's default for
Kimi K3 is `max`). Each provider client translates a level into the parameter its wire
accepts, records what it actually sent, and falls back (once, per model, per run) when
the endpoint rejects the parameter.

Level names a model does not accept map to the NEAREST accepted level by rank, ties going
UP (xhigh on Kimi K3 → max; medium on Kimi K3 → high). The mapping is recorded on every
reply as `{requested, effective, param, note}` so a run record states its effort.

Sources (read 2026-09-08): platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort (supported
models per level; `high` == omitted; hold the level constant within a conversation or
the prompt cache restarts); Moonshot/Together Kimi K3 docs (`reasoning_effort` low/high/max,
default max).
